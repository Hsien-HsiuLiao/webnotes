https://www.treasuredtips.com/how-to-stay-asleep-all-night/ - This mixture helps you stay a sleep throughout the night and also helps reduce the impact of spikes in stress hormones or cortisol, which can often cause you to wake up in the middle of the night. 
 When you don’t have enough liver glycogen to provide energy for the brain, your adrenal glands pump out more of the stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol. When you have adequate sodium in your bloodstream, your stress response is reduced and your body won’t pump out as much adrenaline or cortisol. Salt helps your body stay in a homeostatic state so that your adrenaline won’t spike during the night and cause you to wake up, at horrible times like 2am and 4am.
